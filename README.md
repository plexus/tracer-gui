**This is only a short summary of the Full Text, this information is not legal advice.**

MPL is a copyleft license that works on individual files. Any changes you make to files covered by MPL must be made available under MPL, but you may combine these with non-MPL (proprietary) source files in the same project. Version 2.0 is compatible with GPL version 3. You can distribute binaries under a proprietary license, as long as you make the source available under MPL.
