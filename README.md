# Tracer GUI

## Artifacts

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/tracer-gui.svg)](https://clojars.org/tracer-gui)

## Usage

Wrap your Ring handler in `trace-ring`, a GUI will pop up where you see the
history of request, and you can inspect request and response maps.

Only one window will be open at a time. Evaluate `trace-ring` again to re-open a
closed window.

```
(ns my-app.server
  (:require [tracer-gui.core :refer [trace-ring]]))

(def my-routes ,,, ;; ring routes
  )

(def http-handler
  (trace-ring my-routes))
```
